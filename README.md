# Sipeed M0 Sense

This repo is a personal set of examples running on the [M0Sense](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/maixzero/sense/maix_zero_sense.html) board

## ‚öô Installing
```
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools
pip install bflb-mcu-tool
```

## üöÄ Running
Before running the command, the board should be in programming mode, set IO pin 28 to high before turning the board on, and keep until boot.

After your computer detect the new serial communication device and add a new COM port, run the code to upload the binary to board:

```
cargo objcopy --release --example blinky -- -O binary .bin/blinky.bin
bflb-mcu-tool --chipname bl702 --firmware .bin/blinky.bin
```

Or simply:

```
assets/run.bat blinky
```
